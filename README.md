# Airnote
This is an android application made with Phonegap, compiled in Android Studio. Airnote is an application that allows users to leave messages on their location. Other users and themselves can see these notes utilising the camera on the phone and look around. Notes will pop up on the screen using augmented reality. You could write something on the bathroom wall, you could write down memories in a classroom for others to see.

# Work Environment

* [Download Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

 > Android Studio provides everything you need to start developing apps for Android, including the Android Studio IDE and the Android SDK tools.

 > If you didn't download Android Studio, go download Android Studio now, or switch to the stand-alone SDK Tools install instructions.

 > Before you set up Android Studio, be sure you have installed JDK 6 or higher (the JRE alone is not sufficient)â€”JDK 7 is required when developing for Android 5.0 and higher. To check if you have JDK installed (and which version), open a terminal and type javac -version. If the JDK is not available or the version is lower than version 6, download the Java SE Development Kit 7.

* [Download Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/#!/developers/user-guide)

1. Android Simulator
> Genymotion is an Android emulator which comprises a complete set of sensors and features in order to interact with a virtual Android environment. With Genymotion, you can test your Android applications on a wide range of virtual devices for development, test and demonstration purposes.
Genymotion is fast, simple to install and powerful thanks to user-friendly sensor widgets and interaction features. It is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux operating systems.

2. Genymotion is compatible with the following operating systems:
  * Microsoft Windows, 7, 8/8.1, 10 (32 or 64 bit);
  * Mac OS X 10.8 or above.
  * Linux Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) or above (64 bit);
  * Linux Debian 8 (Jessie) (64 bit).
  

 > Genymotion cannot be run from a virtual machine. Indeed, it needs a direct access to the hardware in order to provide OpenGL acceleration. Running Genymotion from a virtual machine prevents it to directly access the hardware components. Therefore, Genymotion is incompatible when installed from VMWare, Parallels, Hyper-V or VirtualPC.
